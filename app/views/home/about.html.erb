      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Starting a business is challenging enough without worrying about complex insurance requirements. 
        Our mission is to simplify the process of understanding which business insurance is legally required 
        for your specific situation, so you can focus on what you do best - building your business.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
      <p>
        As solopreneurs ourselves, we understand the overwhelm that comes with trying to figure out 
        compliance requirements. Insurance regulations vary significantly by state, industry, and business activities. 
        What's required for a freelance graphic designer in California is completely different from 
        what's needed for a contractor in Texas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Traditional approaches to finding this information involve:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Researching multiple state and local government websites</li>
        <li>Consulting with expensive attorneys or insurance agents</li>
        <li>Wading through complex legal language</li>
        <li>Guessing what applies to your specific situation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We wanted to create a better way - a simple, conversational tool that asks the right questions 
        and provides clear, actionable answers.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Our assessment tool uses a decision tree based on state regulations, industry requirements, 
        and licensing board mandates. We ask only the questions relevant to your specific situation, 
        making the process as quick and painless as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        The recommendations you receive are based on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>State-specific insurance requirements</li>
        <li>Industry-specific regulations</li>
        <li>Professional licensing requirements</li>
        <li>Business activity triggers (employees, vehicles, contracts, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Important Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        While we strive for accuracy, this tool provides general guidance based on common requirements. 
        Insurance laws can change, and every business situation is unique. We always recommend 
        consulting with a licensed insurance professional or attorney for definitive advice about 
        your specific insurance needs.
      </p>
